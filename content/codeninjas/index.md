excerpt: A summer of teaching little kids how to code 💻
---

During the summer of 2019, I worked at a coding instructor at the Chandler, Arizona location of the chain *Code Ninjas*. This was my first formal teaching experience and while I learned a lot about strategies for teaching kids computer science topics, specifically through the block-based programming language [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

I also learned a lot observationally. I heard a little girl make a comment about how there weren't any other girls in the camp. I witnessed countless software developer parents drop their kids off on their way to work in ["Silicon Desert"](https://techaz.org/rise-silicon-desert-tech-companies-moving/). I worked with kids who were coding whizzes and kids who just could never seem to get it. I worked with 6-year-olds and 13-year-olds. Above all, I couldn't help but ruminate on the fact that for all of these kids and parents, $400 was the price of that week-long ticket into the bustling environment full of laptops, Minecraft, and goldfish that is Code Ninjas.

Thus, Code Ninjas was an informative experience for me pedagogically speaking, but also sparked my interest in computer science education. I have long been interested in equity/equality issues in computer science, but this was the first time I witnessed those problems in the context of early childhood education. I was particularly exposed socioeconomic inequity, which of course is not independent of other factors, such as race.

Though I fell into this job somewhat serendipitously, it ended up providing me with an important perspective on an area of the field I previously had not thought deeply about. Additionally, this job ended up being the inspiration for my trip to England to learn about their national curriculum for computer science.
