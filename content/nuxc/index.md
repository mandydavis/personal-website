excerpt: I was fortunate to be a member of Northwestern's varsity cross country team. I loved my team with all my heart. Here's an overview of what it was like to be part of NUXC ðŸ’œ

Above is a picture of some of my teammates and I in the middle of a tempo run along Lake Michigan on a beautiful fall day. It was moments like this that brought our team together; getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and running in a pack as we worked towards a common goal.

For a decade, much of my life and lifestyle has revolved around running, but I wouldn't want to have it any other way. In college, I ran anywhere from 45 to 70 miles a week. Post-graduation, I run much less mileage than that, however, running (trail running, a neighborhood run with a friend, a walk-jog, etc) is still one of my favorite things to do and keeps me sane.
