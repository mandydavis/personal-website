excerpt: An accessible video game controller for people with limited hand mobility ðŸŽ®

During my first year at Northwestern, I had the privilege of taking a class called Design Thinking & Communication, which presents engineering students with real-world projects to tackle over the course of 10 weeks.

I lucked out by partnering with three other teammates that were driven, imaginative, and very fun and easy to work with. In another stroke of luck, us and the other three teams in our class section were assigned the coolest client and project: **to create a one-handed video game controller suitable for patients with hemiplegia at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab**. Together, we decided that, though not required, we were going to make a functional prototype, not just a proof of concept. 

Numerous passionate discussions about design decisions, trips to the Corner Makery at odd hours to get dibs on a 3D printer, an admittedly frightening encounter with a laser cutter, and soldering new connections to an intricate Xbox circuit board we bought off of a local high schooler all culminated into a one beautiful moment late at night in the Mechatronics lab, shamelessly surrounded by an order of Insomnia Cookies. This was the moment in which we plugged inControl into one of our laptops and watched it work on a computer game for the first time. This was a moment of pure bliss that beautifully captured the success of our previous ten weeks of hard work.

After presenting inControl at the design expo held for all sections of the course, we continued our work on the product. We formed an LLC in the state of Illinois and filed for a provisional patent. We began discussing with various Microsoft, and more specifically, Xbox employees (shoutout to the Northwestern alumni network) to explore the options for inControl in the market as a third-party accessory for Xbox. This was all happening around the time of Xbox's release of the [Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC)](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-controller), so it was incredibly exciting to, in a way, have front row seats to that rollout. 

Though inControl is now a passion project of the past as my teammates and I began our own exciting post-graduation plans, I am proud to say that I was a part of making inControl a reality and getting it this far. It was more than fun to engage in a startup culture of sorts as just a freshman in college and truly learn-by-doing, including learning to trust my own ability to learn brand new skills and whatever else was required to accomplish our goal. I am forever grateful for this experience and the people (teammates, classmates, professors, and other supporters) who chose to believe in us and our ambitious ideas.
