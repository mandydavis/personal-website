Using a mix of historical, ethnographic, and statistical techniques, the thesis situates the paradox in its social and political context, documenting its analytic and intellectual limits, and then uses IRB-approved interviews with Moroccan women who are pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science to show how poorly the paradox matches their experiences.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>See more</strong>\n            : Read the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qyo37b6dKDefjOCooo9151Kz594qOjyk/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full thesis</a>.\n            See the announcement for my thesis being a co-winner of the <a href=\"https://shc.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/prize-winners.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Science in Human Culture Essay Prize</a>.\n            {' '}\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"researchTile\">\n          <h3>2020 Circumnavigator's Travel-Study Grant 🌍</h3>\n          <p>\n            Awarded $9,500 to conduct a global research project on the ICT Gender-Equality Paradox.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Though the trip was cancelled indefinitely due to the Coronavirus pandemic, I was awarded the chance to visit\n            {' '}\n            <strong>Morocco</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇲🇦, the\n            {' '}\n            <strong>UK</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇬🇧,\n            {' '}\n            <strong>France</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇫🇷,\n            {' '}\n            <strong>Estonia</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇪🇪,\n            {' '}\n            <strong>Qatar</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇶🇦,\n            {' '}\n            <strong>Singapore</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇸🇬, and\n            {' '}\n            <strong>New Zealand</strong>\n            {' '}\n            🇳🇿 to conduct a\n            {' '}\n            <i>comparative case studies</i>\n            {' '}\n            interview and ethnography based\n            research project about women in tech.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>See more</strong>\n            : You can read my accepted proposal\n            {' '}\n            <a href=\"../Cicumnavigators Proposal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n            .\n            Read more about my project on the Chicago Circumnavigators Club\n            {' '}\n            <a href=\"http://www.chicagocircumnavigators.org/Scholar2020MandyDavis.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">website</a>\n            .\n            Lastly, check out my\n            {' '}\n            <a href=\"https://mandydavis.github.io/ict-gep-re-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">re-analysis of the ICT Gender-Equality Paradox</a>\n            .\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"researchTile\">\n          <h3>Safe at Home?
